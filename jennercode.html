        <h2 >Here's a time line of DR. Jenner's life:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1749: </strong>Edward Jenner was born on May 17 in Berkeley, Gloucestershire, England, to a vicar family. His father died when Edward was young, and he was raised by his older brother.</li>
          <li><strong>1752-1762: </strong>Jenner received his early education at Wotton-under-Edge and later in Cirencester. He showed an early interest in natural science and medicine.
</li>
          <li><strong>1763-1770: </strong>Jenner became an apprentice to Daniel Ludlow, a prominent surgeon in Chipping Sodbury. This apprenticeship gave him practical training in medicine and surgery.</li>
          <li><strong>1770-1773: </strong>He moved to London to study under the renowned surgeon and anatomist John Hunter, who was an important mentor and helped Jenner develop a scientific approach to medicine.</li>
          <li><strong>1773: </strong>Jenner returned to Berkeley and established a successful medical practice. He became a well-known local physician and surgeon.</li>
          <li><strong>1788: </strong>He married Catherine Kingscote, with whom he had three children. They shared a happy family life in Berkeley.</li>
          <li><strong>1796: </strong>Jenner carried out his first experimental vaccination. Noticing that milkmaids who contracted cowpox seemed immune to smallpox, Jenner hypothesized that cowpox could be used to prevent smallpox infection. On May 14, he inoculated an eight-year-old boy, James Phipps, with material from a cowpox sore. This experiment proved successful.</li>
          <li><strong>1798: </strong>Jenner published his findings in a book titled "An Inquiry into the Causes and Effects of the Variolae Vaccinae". This publication coined the term "vaccine" (from "vacca", Latin for cow) and laid the foundation for modern immunology.</li>
          <li><strong>1802: </strong>The British government awarded Jenner £10,000 for his work in vaccination, recognizing its importance to public health.</li>
          <li><strong>1806: </strong>Jenner received another grant of £20,000 from Parliament to further develop and promote vaccination.</li>
          <li><strong>1808: </strong>The Royal Jennerian Society was established to promote vaccination and smallpox prevention across England and beyond. Jenner played a key role in advocating for the widespread use of the smallpox vaccine.</li>
          <li><strong>1813: </strong>Jenner was granted an honorary medical degree by the University of Oxford.</li>
          <li><strong>1816: </strong>His wife, Catherine, passed away, which affected Jenner deeply. After her death, he gradually withdrew from active medical practice.</li>
          <li><strong>1823: </strong>Edward Jenner died on January 26 in Berkeley at the age of 73. He was buried in the churchyard of St. Mary's Church, Berkeley.</li>
        </ul>
